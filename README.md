School Performance Analysis


In this comprehensive analysis, we explored the factors influencing school performance using a rich dataset containing information about various schools. Our objective was to gain insights into the dynamics between school attributes and academic achievement. 

The analysis began by categorising schools based on their spending per student. This segmentation allowed us to investigate how financial resources are linked to academic outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that schools with lower budgets per student, those spending less than $585 per student, exhibited consistently better academic performance. These schools not only achieved higher mean scores in both math and reading but also had greater success rates in both subjects. This discovery challenges the common assumption that greater financial investment necessarily leads to improved academic outcomes, highlighting the importance of resource allocation and efficiency in education.

Furthermore, the analysis extended to categorising schools by size and type, which provided additional perspectives on school performance dynamics. By delving into these three critical aspects, we uncovered valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of educational achievement, offering a foundation for informed policy decisions and strategies to enhance educational quality.

In conclusion, this analysis underscores the importance of resource management in education and highlights the potential benefits of diverse governance structures. These findings could inform policy decisions and educational strategies, ultimately enhancing the quality of education in schools.
